# GrowUp
A project for our SCRUM class.

Our app is for people who are living in the city, teenagers and newbiees in planting between the age 15-25 who want to start growing their own pentry.
The app will provide information about the different plants and will make sure through notifications that you remember to take care of your plants when you need to.
No more dead plants - download growUp today and become a pro in a minute!
